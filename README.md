# message.sh
### A simple script to send messages
Bash script to automatically send messages. This has been tested so far, and works, on Discord and Facebook Messenger.

### Dependencies
[xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool) needs to be installed to simulate keyboard inputs.

### Message Scheduling
The execution of this script can be scheduled to run at a specific time by using cron. Useful when you don't want to wake up to wish your friend on their birthday.
